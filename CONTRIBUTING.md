# 🎸 Join the Band (Contributing)

So, you want to join the **Bandline** tour? We love guest appearances and new members! But like any great band, we have a few rules to keep the rhythm tight.

## 🚫 No Divas (Code of Conduct)

1.  **Respect the Crew**: Treat everyone with respect. No egos on the tour bus.
2.  **Harmonize**: Your code should blend well with the existing style. Don't solo over the vocals.
3.  **Keep it Tuned**: Ensure your code passes all tests before soundcheck.

## 🎸 Auditions (Pull Requests)

Ready to show us what you've got?

1.  **Fork the Playlist**: Create your own fork of the repo.
2.  **Pick a Song**: Create a branch for your feature (`feat/cool-riff`) or fix (`fix/broken-string`).
3.  **Rehearse**: Run `pnpm test` locally.
4.  **Send the Demo**: Open a Pull Request.
5.  **Code Review**: Wait for a band member to review your solo.

## 🎼 Jamming (Development Workflow)

- **Issues**: Found a broken string? Open an Issue on GitHub.
- **Commits**: Use semantic messages.
    - `feat:` A new song.
    - `fix:` Tuning a string.
    - `docs:` Writing liner notes.
    - `style:` Polishing the instruments.

## 🤘 Let's Rock!

We can't wait to hear your contribution. Grab an instrument and let's make some noise!
